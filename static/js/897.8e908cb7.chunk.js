This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.\r\nNote: Images with loading set to lazy will never be loaded if they do not intersect a visible part of an element, even if loading them would change that as unloaded images have a width and height of 0.
